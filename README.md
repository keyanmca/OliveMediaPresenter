OliveMediaPresenter
===================

Software for digital presentation and digital signage. It allows you present videos in a professional manner. This application gives you total control of your playlist without showing the audience the playing and switching of the videos. This application will also loop videos for digital signage. 

Future Goal: To permit remote control of multiple digital signage devices on the same local network. 

## Instructions ##
Place .mk4, .avi and .wmv files in C:\\Users\\<username>\\Videos\\Presentation 

**Note:** this software will only play files that uses codecs that are installed on the computer. If you can play it in Windows Media Player on that computer then this software should also play it. 

On start up the application will load the files in alphabetical order starting at 1. I recommend starting the names with numbers like: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, and so on. 

### Keys ###

Numbers 0-9: Queue from files in order from 1 - 10. 0 representing the 10th video file. 

Space Bar: Play queued video is stopped, load and play next queued video is one is queued

S : Stop playing

P : Pause playing

L : Reload files from the "Presentation" folder in "My Videos"

X : Enables looping of the currently queued video. It does not automatically start that video playing.  

ESC: Close application
