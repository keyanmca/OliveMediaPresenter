OliveMediaPresenter
===================

Software for remote/local digital presentation and digital signage.

Place .mk4, .avi and .wmv files in C:\Users\<username>\Videos\Presentation

On startup the application will load the files in alphabetical order starting at 1. I recommend starting the names with numbers like: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, and so on. 

Numbers 0-9: Queue from files in order from 1 - 10. 0 represending the 10th video file. 
Space Bar: Play Queued Video
S : Stop Playing
P : Pause Playing
L : Reload files from the "Presentation" folder in "My Videos"
ESC: Close Application

Note: Place the files in the directory in alphabetical order in which you want them to load on your number keys.
